The codes contained in this repository range from regression of gravitational models to the dynamics of spiral galaxies to classification of objects, e.g. galaxies, stars and quasars. In addition to an unsupervised approach involving the identification of galaxy clusters. Some of these codes are under development and do not configure the final structure.
